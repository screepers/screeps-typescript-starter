# Contributing to the docs

We welcome contributions to the docs! We're looking for ways to make the starter kit documentation better, as well as many other tips and tricks about Screeps AI development in TypeScript. If you feel like some parts of the docs need fixing/improving, definitely create a pull request.

For guidelines on contributing to the starter kit, [click here](https://github.com/screepers/screeps-typescript-starter/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Gitbook

Our documentation is built using [Gitbook](https://www.gitbook.com/), and are accessible [here](https://screepers.gitbooks.io/screeps-typescript-starter/). You can also start working on the docs locally by installing the Gitbook CLI.

```bash
npm install -g gitbook-cli
```

To run a local Gitbook server, run the following command on the project's root directory.

```bash
gitbook serve
```
